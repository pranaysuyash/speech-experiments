# Pre-flight Check (pre-flight-check-v1.0)

**Purpose:** Anti-drift checks before starting work.

Checklist:

- Confirm the intended scope and acceptance criteria.
- Ensure `git status --porcelain` is clean (or note uncommitted changes and why).
- Search for any related open tickets in `docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md`.
- Verify there are no outstanding audit findings related to the scope.
- Note the prompts you will use and add them to the plan.

Use this checklist before making changes or starting a ticketed implementation.
