综合数十份资料后，我厘清了各方案在性能、成本与扩展性上的关键差异，为最终选型奠定依据。
TL;DR: The audio AI landscape in early 2026 is dominated by OpenAI Whisper for multilingual speech recognition, Meta wav2vec 2.0 for high-accuracy English ASR, Google Gemini Audio for multimodal contextual understanding, and Microsoft MAI-Voice-1 for Chinese-optimized enterprise deployment. For audio generation, Meta AudioCraft leads open-source research despite licensing restrictions, Stability AI Stable Audio 2.5 targets enterprise production with legal safety, and emerging models like ACE-Step 1.5 and Fish Speech V1.5 challenge commercial alternatives with permissive licensing. Key trade-offs span accuracy vs. robustness, speed vs. quality, and licensing flexibility vs. legal certainty.
