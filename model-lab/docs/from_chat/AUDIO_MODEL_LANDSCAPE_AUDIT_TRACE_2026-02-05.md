## Raw trace (as shared)

I’ll let you know once the structured report is ready for your review.

Surveying the audio-model universe, I’m mapping every niche from ASR to bioacoustics so our lab’s next rollout blankets the whole sonic spectrum.

audio models hugging face

I noticed Hugging Face Diffusers hosts audio-capable diffusion models, so I’m now drilling down to catalog the specific audio models available.

我注意到的标题暗示了音频分类的实战示例，决定深入挖掘其中可能隐藏的模型细节。

Surveying reveals only a generic PyTorch primer, so I’m pivoting to a wider “Hugging Face audio” sweep to flush out model names and categories.

Searched
hugging face audio

Reframing my query to “models audio hugging face,” I’m hoping to surface a clearer catalog of Hugging Face’s open audio models for the audit.

models audio hugging face

Delving into Hugging Face’s audio AutoModels guide should reveal the local model landscape.

I'm broadening my lens beyond Hugging Face to map the full audio-model ecosystem across OpenAI, Google, Meta and IBM.

Searched
all audio models

Realizing "all audio models" was too vague, I'm now zeroing in on a panoramic audio-model landscape spanning speech, music, enhancement and beyond.

Searched
audio processing models

I’m now homing in on the Emergent Mind article to map out the full spectrum of audio models across speech, music, and environmental domains.
