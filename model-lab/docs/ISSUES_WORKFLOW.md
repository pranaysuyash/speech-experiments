# Issues Workflow Policy

**Canonical Source:** `docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md` is the single source of truth for work tracking.

- All issues must be converted to worklog tickets using `prompts/workflow/worklog-v1.0.md`.
- External issues (GitHub, etc.) should be triaged into tickets.
- Tickets are append-only; status updates add new entries.
- Reference tickets in PRs, commits, and code comments.

No work without a ticket.
