This is a speech quality and regression test for STT and TTS.

Today's date is 2026-01-09. The sample rate is 16000 Hz and the file is mono.
Numbers matter: 29.9 dB SNR, -36.1 LUFS, and true peak at -15.9 dBTP.
If you hear "twenty-nine point nine", that is acceptable too, but the digits should appear in the transcript.

Acronyms matter. Say these clearly:
GPT, GPT-4, RLHF, ASR, TTS, VAD, LUFS, dBFS, dBTP, SNR, WER, CER, and JSON.

Hyphens matter. These words should stay intact:
self-supervised, few-shot, zero-shot, open-source, and real-time.
Also say: "billions to trillions", not "billions tutorials".

Now a small minimal-pairs block:
context vs contact,
acquire vs require,
generated vs generative,
model vs modal.

Punctuation is not required in the transcript.
But words should be correct after normalization: lowercase, no punctuation, collapsed whitespace.

End of test.
