This is a speech quality and regression test for STT and TTS.  Today's date is 2000 and 26-0109.  The sample rate is 16,000 Hz and the file is mono.  Numbers matter, 29.9 dB SNR, minus 36.1 LUFs, and true peak at minus 15.9 dBTP.  If you hear 29.9, that is acceptable too, but the digits should appear in the transcript.  Pronames matter, say these clearly, GPT, GPT4, RLHF, ASR, TTS, VAD, LUFs, DBFS, DBTP, SNR, WER,  SAY, and JSON, hyphens matter.  These words should stay intact, self-supervised, few-shot, zero-shot, open-source, and real-time.  Also say, billions to trillions, not billions to tutorials.  Now a small minimal pairs block, context versus contact, acquire versus require, generated  versus generative, model versus model, punctuation is not required in the transcript, but words  should be correct after normalization, lowercase, no punctuation, collapsed white space, end
