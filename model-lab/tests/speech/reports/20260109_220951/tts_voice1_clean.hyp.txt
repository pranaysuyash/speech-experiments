This is a speech quality and regression test for STT and TTS.  Today's date is January 9th, 2026.  The sample rate is 16,000 hertz and the file is mono.  Numbers matter, 29.9 decibels SNR, minus 36.1 luffs,  and true peak at minus 15.9 dBTP.  If you hear 29.9, that is acceptable too,  but the digits should appear in the transcript.  acronyms matter, say these clearly, G-P-T, G-P-T-4, R-L-H-F, A-S-R, T-T-S, VAD,  Luffs, D-B-F-S, D-B-T-P, SNR, Wear, Ser, and J-S-O-N.  Hiphons matter, these words should stay intact, self-supervised,  few-shot, zero-shot, open-source, and real-time.  Also say, billions to trillions, not billions to tutorials.  Now a small minimal pairs block, context versus contact,  acquire versus require, generated versus generative,  model versus modal, punctuation is not required in the transcript,  but words should be correct after normalization, lowercase,  no punctuation, collapsed white space, end of test.
