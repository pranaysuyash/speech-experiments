claims:
  claimed_strengths:
    - "real_time_speech_to_speech"
    - "conversational_audio"
    - "interleaved_generation"
  recommended_usage:
    - "For V2V: use interleaved generation (real-time mode)"
    - "For ASR/TTS: use sequential generation"
  known_limitations_claimed:
    - "May require GPU for optimal performance"

declared_capabilities:
  - task: "v2v"
    role: "primary"
    notes: "Hero use-case: real-time speech-to-speech interaction (Conversational)."
    
  - task: "asr"
    role: "secondary"
    notes: "Designed for dialogue understanding, not verbatim transcription."

  - task: "tts"
    role: "secondary"
    notes: "Functional text-to-speech, but optimized for stability over expressivity."
