# ASR Smoke Test Dataset
# Minimal structural test for ASR capability
# Uses existing audio from golden dataset

name: asr_smoke
version: "1.0"
task_type: asr

# Smoke thresholds are lenient - just needs to produce output
thresholds:
  wer_mean: 0.50           # Max 50% WER for smoke
  success_rate: 0.80       # 80% must not error
  min_completeness: 0.30   # Must produce some output
