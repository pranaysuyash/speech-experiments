# v1: clean_speech + silence
# v2: noisy_speech (mixed) + speech_like (should trigger but limited)

description: "VAD smoke v2 - noisy and speech-like audio"
cases:
  - id: "noisy_speech"
    audio_file: "data/audio/noisy_speech_10s_10pct.wav"
    expected_speech_ratio_min: 0.3
    expected_segments_min: 1
    notes: "Noisy speech should still be detected"

  - id: "speech_like"
    audio_file: "data/audio/speech_like_4s.wav"
    expected_speech_ratio_min: 0.05
    expected_speech_ratio_max: 0.95
