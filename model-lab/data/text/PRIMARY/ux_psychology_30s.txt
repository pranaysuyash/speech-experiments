User experience psychology draws from cognitive science principles like Miller's Law, which states that humans can hold about seven items in working memory, plus or minus two. This fundamental constraint shapes how we design interfaces, menus, and information architecture. Modern AI systems must respect these cognitive limitations while providing intelligent assistance that augments rather than overwhelms human decision-making.
