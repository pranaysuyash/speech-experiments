LLMs can be\u00a0fine-tuned\u00a0for specific tasks or guided by\u00a0prompt engineering.These models acquire\u00a0predictive power\u00a0regarding\u00a0syntax,\u00a0semantics, and\u00a0ontologies\u00a0inherent in human\u00a0language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and\u00a0biases\u00a0present in the\u00a0data\u00a0they are trained on.\nThey consist of billions to trillions of\u00a0parameters\u00a0and operate as general-purpose sequence models, generating, summarizing, translating, and reasoning over text. LLMs represent a significant new technology in their ability to generalize across tasks with minimal task-specific supervision, enabling capabilities like\u00a0conversational agents,\u00a0code generation,\u00a0knowledge retrieval, and\u00a0automated reasoning\u00a0that previously required bespoke systems.\nLLMs evolved from earlier\u00a0statistical\u00a0and\u00a0recurrent neural network\u00a0approaches to language modeling. The\u00a0transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, replaced recurrence with\u00a0self-attention, allowing efficient\u00a0parallelization, longer context handling, and scalable training on unprecedented data volumes. This innovation enabled models like\u00a0GPT,\u00a0BERT, and their successors, which demonstrated\u00a0emergent behaviors\u00a0at scale, such as\u00a0few-shot learning\u00a0and compositional reasoning.\nReinforcement learning, particularly\u00a0policy gradient algorithms, has been adapted to\u00a0fine-tune\u00a0LLMs for desired behaviors beyond raw next-token prediction.\u00a0Reinforcement learning from human feedback\u00a0(RLHF) applies these methods to optimize a policy, the LLM's output distribution, against reward signals derived from human or automated preference judgments. This has been critical for aligning model outputs with user expectations, improving factuality, reducing harmful responses, and enhancing task performance.\nBenchmark\u00a0evaluations for LLMs have evolved from narrow linguistic assessments toward comprehensive,\u00a0multi-task\u00a0evaluations measuring\u00a0reasoning,\u00a0factual accuracy,\u00a0alignment, and\u00a0safety.\u00a0Hill climbing, iteratively optimizing models against benchmarks, has emerged as a dominant strategy, producing rapid incremental performance gains but raising concerns of\u00a0overfitting\u00a0to benchmarks rather than achieving genuine\u00a0generalization\u00a0or robust capability improvements.",
